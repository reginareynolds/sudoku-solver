# GENERAL PROGRAM OVERVIEW
# 1. Scrape sudoku puzzle from New York Times
# 2. Parse scraped puzzle
# 3. Create visual puzzle representation
# 4. Solve for missing squares and update visual puzzle representation

# Rows will range in value from 0-8
# Columns will range in value from 0-8
# Boxes will range in value from 0-8

# Possible square solutions will depend on other squares in the same row, column, and box
# Solved cells remove their solution as a possibility from unsolved cells in the same row/column/box
# If a cell has only one possible solution, that must be the solution for that cell.
# If an unsolved value in a group (row, column, box) has only one possible group cell it can appear in, it must appear in that cell.
# If the puzzle is still not solved at that point, further processing is necessary.
